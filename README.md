## What Works on Which File :
   # Main.py 
   1.Data Fetching:
     Retrieves current weather and forecast data from specified locations using the WeatherService class.
   2.Processing and Alerts:
     Processes the fetched weather data and checks for alerts using the AlertService class, logging any triggered alerts.
   3.Visualization:
     Displays daily weather summaries and forecasts through the Visualization class.
   4.Error Handling:
     Manages network errors and JSON parsing issues, ensuring reliable operation and logging any errors encountered.
   5.Duration Control:
     Allows monitoring to run for a defined duration, automatically terminating after the specified period.

 # alert_service.py
   1.Threshold Management:
      Initializes default thresholds for temperature, humidity, and wind speed.
      Allows setting custom thresholds for specific weather conditions.
   2.Temperature Conversion:
      Converts temperature from Kelvin to Celsius and Fahrenheit using dedicated methods (kelvin_to_celsius and kelvin_to_fahrenheit).
   3.Alert Checking:
      Monitors weather data for specified locations, checking if any conditions exceed defined thresholds:
        a.Temperature Alerts: Generates alerts if the temperature exceeds the set threshold and tracks consecutive exceedances.
        b.Humidity Alerts: Generates alerts if humidity exceeds the defined threshold.
        c.Wind Speed Alerts: Generates alerts if wind speed exceeds the set threshold.
      Logs errors when required data is missing, ensuring robustness in data processing.
   4.Alert Sending:
      Provides functionality to send alerts through the send_alert method, logging the message being sent.
   5.Alert Evaluation:
      Evaluates and processes alerts based on the current weather data, invoking both the alert checking and sending functions in one method (evaluate_alerts).
# visualation.py
   1. Bar Chart Display:
      (a)display_bar_chart:
        Creates and displays a bar chart using Matplotlib.
        Accepts parameters for the chart title, x-axis labels, y-values, y-axis label, and colors for the bars.
        Configures the chart layout, including size, title, labels, and grid lines for better readability.
   2. Daily Summary Visualization:
      (a)display_summary:
         Iterates over daily weather summaries and validates each summary.
         If valid, calls display_bar_chart to visualize average, maximum, and minimum temperatures, average humidity, and average wind speed.
         If validation fails, it prints an error message with the day's summary.
   3. Forecast Summary Visualization:
      (a)display_forecast_summary:
        Iterates over forecast summaries for different locations on specified days.
        Validates each summary before visualization.
        If valid, visualizes average temperature, average humidity, and average wind speed using display_bar_chart.
        Prints an error message for any invalid summaries.
   4. Summary Validation:
      (a)validate_summary:
         Checks if all required keys are present in the summary dictionary.
         Customizes required keys based on whether the summary is for a daily report or a forecast.
   5.Batch Visualization:
      (a)run_batch_visualization:
         Accepts a list of daily summaries and displays each one sequentially.
      (b)run_batch_forecast_visualization:
        Accepts a list of forecast summaries and displays each one sequentially.
# weather_aggregator.py 
   1.Initialization:
      (a) __init__:
         Initializes an empty dictionary to hold daily weather data (daily_data).
         Sets current_date to None.
   2.Weather Data Collection:
     (a)collect_weather_data:
        Fetches the current date and formats it as a string (YYYY-MM-DD).
        Checks if current_date is set; if not, initializes it with the current date.
        If the date has changed since the last collection, it aggregates the previous day's data and clears daily_data.
        Iterates over the provided weather data, extracting temperature in Kelvin, converting it to Celsius, and appending it to the list of temperatures for each location.
   3.Daily Data Aggregation:
      (a)aggregate_daily_data:
       Calculates daily summaries for each location from the collected temperature data.
       Computes average, maximum, and minimum temperatures for the day.
       Creates a summary dictionary containing the date, location, average temperature, maximum temperature, and minimum temperature.
       Calls store_daily_summary to log the daily summary.
   4.Daily Summary Storage:
      (a)store_daily_summary:
         Logs the daily summary information using the logging module at the INFO level.
   5.Temperature Conversion:

     Initializes dictionaries to store daily and forecast summaries.
   2.Fetching Weather Data:
     Uses the OpenWeather API to fetch current weather and forecast data.
     Implements a retry mechanism for handling request failures.
   3.Data Processing:
     Processes current weather data to calculate temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions.
    Groups daily weather data by date and location.

   3.Inserting Data:
     Inserts or updates weather summaries using the insert_summaries function.
     Utilizes ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE to handle existing entries.
   4.Retrieving Data:
     Implements a function (get_average_temperature) to calculate and return the average temperature for a specified location.
# weather_monitor.py
   1.Argument Parsing:
     Uses argparse to handle command-line arguments for locations to monitor and a temperature threshold.
     locations: List of locations (required).
     threshold: Temperature threshold for alerts (default is 35Â°C).
   2.Temperature Alert Checking:
     check_temperature_alert(weather_data, threshold): This function iterates through fetched weather data and checks if the temperature exceeds the specified threshold.
     Alerts are generated for locations where the temperature is above the threshold.
   3.Testing:
     test_temperature_alerts(): A unit test function that verifies the alert mechanism using predefined test data. It checks if the function correctly identifies locations exceeding the temperature threshold.
   4.Main Execution Flow:
     Parses command-line arguments to get the list of locations and threshold.
     Instantiates a WeatherService object to fetch weather data using an API key.
     For each location, it fetches weather data and populates a dictionary.
     Calls the alert checking function and prints any alerts to the console
